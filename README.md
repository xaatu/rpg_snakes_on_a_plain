# Snakes On A Plain

## Description

I made this game, originally following a guide I saw from YouTuber "Shawcode". 
While the tutorial was extremely helpful, it had certain limitations. For example, the single tilemap meant you could have blocks or
grass on the ground, and a default grass floor. However, this meant that when I wanted to add a dirt path, I was unable to place a tree on it,
or items such as the axe, as it would default to the grassy tile.

## Updates

- items
- inventory to store items
- a specific class for non-inventory items (such as trees)
- more levels
- itemmap as well as tilemap, so items/player/trees etc can be stacked on top of any floor surface.
  this also makes creating new levels much easier.
- score keeping graphic in the top right of the screen
- new pixel art for character/enemies/axe/tree/dirt path
- popup text when enemies are killed, or the game is giving instructions
